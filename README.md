# AnimationFinalProject
This is the final project created by Nicola Frachesen and Natalie Rumak for CAP3034,
a 3D animation class at the University of Florida.

The files for the Leon, Delgo, and Diva characters were provided by our professor,
and Nico (monster) was found online at http://www.creativecrash.com/maya/downloads/character-rigs/c/nico .

The castle scene was modeled by Nicola Frachesen for a previous 3D modeling class.
